    Returns the list of `user_ids` of the user's followers.


    **Note:** The length of this followers' list might be different from what you get in 
    the "Get User Info" Endpoint. It's because, this list doesn't include Medium Users who 
    left the platform.

    If you really need the exact followers' count, use this endpoint to get the followers' 
    list and take its length as the exact followers' count
